# COMP 346 - Operating Systems

## Concepts covered before midterm

The class wasn't taught in a "classic" linear progression way. Meaning that it didn't really follow the structure of the textbook or online videos teaching the same concepts. We took some modules from a chapter and some modules from another. At the end of the day, same material was covered but sometimes it's hard to follow. So here's my attempt at ordering the concepts in a way that made sense to me


## My attempt at a table of contents:
|File| Short description of what it covers
|------------------|--------------------|
|[1: Overview](OS.md)| Definition, Examples, Elements, Services|
|[2: Architecture](Architecture.md)| Sample architectures, Concerns|
|[3: Registers](Registers.md)| Definition, Types|
|[4: Process Control Block (PCB)](PCB.md)| Definition |
|[5: Program](Program.md)| Definition |
|[6: Process](Process.md)| Definition, Example, LifeCycle, Program vs Process  |
|[7: Process Execution States](Process_execution_states.md)| Complements Lifecycle|
|[8: Process Queues](Process_queues.md)| Usage, Example|
|[9: Protection](Protection.md)| Concerns, Kernel and user modes|
|[10: Context Switch](Context_switch.md)| Definition, Example, Usage|
|[11: System Calls](System_calls.md)| Definition, Linux examples, Types|
|[12: Input and Output (I/O) ](IO.md)| Definition, Control, Polling, Interrupts|
|[13: Interrupts](Interrupts.md)| Definition|
|[14: Traps](Trap.md)| Definition, Example|
|[15: Threads](Thread.md)| Definition, Example, Thread vs Process, Types, Models, LifeCycle(States), Threads in Java, When to use |
|[16: Synchronization](Synchronization.md)| Brief example|
|[17: Process Synchronization](Process_Synchronization.md)| [Producer Consumer Problem](Producer_consumer_problem.md), Details about Critical Section, Test and set lock, [Semaphores](Semaphores.md)|
