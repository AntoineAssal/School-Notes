# Critical Section Recap 
<hr>

## What is a critical section?

A code segment that accesses shared variables and has to be executed as an atomic action (starts and finishes without any interruption).
**Problem** : If not handled properly, some mismatch in the data will end up being transferred between process-created problems.

## Solutions?
- **Mutual exclusion semaphore**: Used as a lock between processes.
- **Progress**: If no process is in the `CS` and other processes wish to enter the `CS`, they can't wait indefinitely. In other words, the process should eventually be able to complete.
- **Bounded waiting**: A bound exists on the number of times other processes are allowed to enter their `CS`s after a process has made a request to enter it's own `CS` and before that request is granted.


## Enabling/Disabling Interrupts
Disabling interrupts within critical sections is the first & simplest way we saw to prevent other processes from accessing the `CS` and ensuring mutual exclusion without using `sempahores`.\
Problem with that is it will only work with uni-processors. \
Disabling and enabling interrupts are `CPU` or core related functions and not `OS-wide`. So on multiprocessors, where each `CPU` executes their own code at the same time, if one `CPU` disables interrupts, another might not. 

## Acquiring a lock
Use the example of locking the door on your way out and unlock it on the way in. 
- Essentialy we're calling `acquire()` on the lock before entering the `CS`
- Then we call `release()` on the lock after getting out of it. 
- We need to follow exactly this order :\
`acquire()` &#8594; use shared data in `CS` &#8594; `release()`.

## Should one lock be used to protect different `CS`s? 
No, because of [deadlocks](deadlock.md) (to be discussed in more depth later  

For now:
- Deadlock occurs when a `process/thread` enters a `waiting` state because a requested ressource is held by another `waiting process` which is also waiting for another ressource held by another `waiting process`.
- If a process can't change its state indefinitely because the requested ressources are being used by another waiting process, then that's **`Deadlock`**.

## Evolving the CS Solution

### Use of `Fork()/Join()`
- An exisiting `process` can use `fork()` to create a new `process/thread`, which creates `concurrency`.
- This `new thread` becomes the `child process` of the calling `parent process`.
- When the `child` has finished its task, it will call `join()` with its `parent` (which has been waiting for it to join).
- That will make the `child` exit its task.
- Then the `parent process` will be able to continue doing its own task (once all children finish their tasks if we have more than one).

## What is Synchronization?
The coordination of multiple threads' execution with the goal being to ensure a desired outcome without corrupting the shared data and preventing any occurrence of deadlocks and race conditions. 

## What is a Semaphore?
It is simply a variable value which is used to control access to a common/shared resource between multiple processes in multiprogramming.
