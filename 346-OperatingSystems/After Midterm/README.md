# Concepts covered after midterm
<hr>

The class wasn't taught in a "classic" linear progression way. Meaning that it didn't really follow the structure of the textbook or online videos teaching the same concepts. We took some modules from a chapter and some modules from another. At the end of the day, same material was covered but sometimes it's hard to follow. So here's my attempt at ordering the concepts in a way that made sense to me


## My attempt at a table of contents:
|File| Short description of what it covers
|------------------|--------------------|
|[1: Critical Section Recap](Critical_section.md)| BIG Recap|
|[2: Systems Recap](Systems.md)|ld
|[3: Schedulers](Schedulers.md)| Types, Metrics|
|[4: Scheduling](Scheduling.md)| Scheduling Algorithms, Types|
|[5: High-Level Synchronization](Monitors.md)| Monitors, Types|
|[6: Deadlocks](Deadlocks.md)| 
|[7: Memory Management](Memory_Management.md)| 
|[8: Paging](Paging.md)| 
|[9: Segmentation](Segmentation.md)| 
|[10: Virtual Memory](Virtual_Memory.md)| 
|[11: Demand Paging](Demand_Paging.md)| 
|[12: Page Replacement](Page_Replacement.md)|
