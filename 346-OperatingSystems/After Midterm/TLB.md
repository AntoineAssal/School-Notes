# Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
- The TLB is an associative, high speed memory.
- Consists of two parts:
  1. A key :
  2. A value :
  
- When the associative memory is presented with an item, the item is compared with all the keys simultaneously.
- If the item is found, the corresponding value field is returned.
- This search happens very quickly.

## Usage of TLB with Page Table
- The TLB contains only a few of the page-table entries. (page number, frame number)
- When a logical address is generated by the CPU, its page number is presented to the TLB.
  - If the page number is found, its frame number is immediately available and is used to access memory. This is known as a TLB Hit.
  - If the page number is not in the TLB, a memory reference to the page table must be made. This is known as a TLB Miss. 
    - When its obtained, we can use it to access memory.
    - We also add the (page number, frame number) to the TLB so we can find them faster next time.
