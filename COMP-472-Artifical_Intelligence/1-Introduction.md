# Types of AI
## 1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence `ANI`
- Also known as weak AI.
- Involves applying AI only to specific tasks.
- A system whose capabilities are not intended to match or exceed the capabilities of human beings.
- A system that can perform a specific intellectual task as well as a human would.
- An example of this would be SIRI or ALEXA:
  - Captures the question we ask "What time is it".
  - Returns the answer it got from the `API`.


## 2. Artificial General Intelligence `AGI`
- Also known as strong AI or General AI.
- Involves machines that posses the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can.
- An example is thinking and reasoning like a human:
  - There are no real world applications right now.


## 3. Artificial Super Intelligence `ASI`
- Also known as Super AI.
- Refers to the time when AI's capability of problem solving will surpass humans.
- Used in Sci-fi movies.

# Intelligence Tests

## 1. The Turing Test
- Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950
- Based on the assumption that if a human interrogator cannot tell the computer and the human apart, then the computer is intelligent.

## 2. Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart `CAPTCHA`
- The system asks a user to complete a test which the computer is able to generate and grade, but not able to solve it.
- Given that computers cannot solve the `CAPTCHA`, any user entering a correct solution is presumed to be a human.
- Also known as `Reverse Turing Test` because it is given by a machine to a human.

# What is AI
According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, artificial intelligence is:
```
The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
decision-making, and translation between languages.
```
Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as:
```
The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
```

## Programming
The main idea is using `declarative programming` which :
- Expresses the logic of a computation without describing the control flow.
- Starts with a formal problem specification
  - A concise description of the problem that is to be solved.
- Used as the basis for `PROLOG`.
- Makes it hard to solve practical problems because its not always possible to specify them in a completely logical framework.
- Can be used for `Search problems` where the task is to find a path in a graph :
  - Typical example is what we saw in the slides [15 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).
- Can be used for Games like chess or checkers.
- Can be used for Constraint satisfaction problems.
