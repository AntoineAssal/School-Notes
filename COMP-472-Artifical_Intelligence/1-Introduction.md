# Types of AI
## 1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence `ANI`
- Also known as weak AI.
- Involves applying AI onlt to specific tasks.
- A system whose capabilities are not intended to match or exceed the capabilities of human beings.
- A system that can perform a specific intellectual task as well as a human would.
- An example of this would be SIRI or ALEXA:
  - Captures the question we ask "What time is it".
  - Returns the answer it got from the `API`.


## 2. Artificial General Intelligence `AGI`
- Also known as strong AI or General AI.
- Involves machines that posess the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can.
- An example is thinking and reasoning like a human:
  - There are no real world applications right now.


## 3. Artifical Super Intelligence `ASI`
- Also known as Super AI.
- Refers to the time when AI's capability of problem solving will surpass humans.
- Used in Sci-fi movies.

# Intelligence Tests

## 1. The Turing Test
- Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950
- Based on the assumption that if a human interrogator cannot tell the computer and the human apart, then the computer is intelligent.

## 2. Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart `CAPTCHA`
- The system asks a user to complete a test which the computer is able to generate and grade, but not able to solve it.
- Given that computers cannot solve the `CAPTCHA`, any user entering a correct solution is presumed to be a human.
- Also known as `Reverse Turing Test` because it is given by a machine to a human.
