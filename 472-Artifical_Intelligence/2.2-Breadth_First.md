# Breadth-Frist Search BFS
`BFS` uses a *queue* which follows the `FIFO` structure, so `nodes` or `states` are added at the end of the list.
When all actions have the same cost, this might be an appropriate strategy to use. In this algorithm, the root node is expanded first, then all the successors of the root node are expanded next, then their successors, and so on. This is a systematic search strategy that is therefore complete even on infinite state spaces.

At each stage, the node to be expanded next is indicated by the triangular marker.

## Show me the code ðŸ¤“
The script is [here](Scripts/2_2_BFS.py)

```py
def bfs(start, goal, next_states):
    Frontier = {start}
    Visited = set()
    Parent = {start: start}
    while len(Frontier) > 0:
        NewFrontier = set()
        for s in Frontier:
            for ns in next_states(s):
                if ns not in Visited and ns not in Frontier:
                    NewFrontier.add(ns)
                    Parent[ns] = s
                    if ns == goal:
                        return path_to(goal, Parent)
```



## How does it work?

1. Given the search problem: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\bg_black&space;P&space;=&space;\left&space;\langle&space;Q,&space;next\_states,\:&space;start,\:&space;goal&space;\right&space;\rangle" title="P = \left \langle Q, next\_states,\: start,\: goal \right \rangle" /> we initialize a set `Frontier` to contain the states that have just been discovered but and whose successors have not been visited, so at the beginning `Frontier` contains the state `start`.
2. As long as the set `Frontier` does not contain the state `goal`, we re-run it by adding all the reachable states (that can be reached in one step from a state in Frontier).
3. Then we move the states that have been previously present in `Frontier` to the `Visited` set.
   - This helps us avoid looping. Once a state has been added to `Visited` we never revisit it again.
4. To keep track of the path leading to the goal we use a dictionary called `Parent`.
   - For every state `s` that is in `Frontier`, `Parent[s]` is the state that caused `s` to be added to `Frontier`.

## More Formal Explanation
As mentioned **A search problem** is a Tuple of the form:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\bg_black&space;P&space;=&space;\left&space;\langle&space;Q,&space;next\_states,\:&space;start,\:&space;goal&space;\right&space;\rangle" title="P = \left \langle Q, next\_states,\: start,\: goal \right \rangle" />

- In the code `start` is the **start state** of the search problem.
- `goal` is the **goal state**
- `next_states` is a function `Q â†’ 2`<sup>`Q`</sup>, where `Q` is the set of states.
  - For every state `s âˆˆ Q`, `next_states(s)` is the set of states that can be reached from `s` in one step.
- `Frontier` is the set of all states that have been encountered but whose neighbors have not yet been explored. At the beginning it contains the state `start`.
- `Visited` is the set of all states whose neighbours have already been added to the set `Frontier`. These 2 sets avoid having infinite loops.
- `Parent` is a dictionary keeping drack of the predecessors of the state that have been reached.     
  - `Start` state is its own predecessor.
- As long as the set `Frontier` is not empty, we add all neighbours of states in `Frontier` that have not yet been visited to the set `NewFrontier`. By doing so, we keep track of the path leading to a new state `ns` by storing its predecessor in the dictionary `Parent`.
- If the new state is the goal state, return a path leading from start to goal.
- After collecting all sucessors of states in `Frontier`, the states in set `Frontier` are added to the set `Visited` and `Frontier` is updated to `NewFrontier`.
  
## Important Information

- `BFS` touches nearly all the states that are reachables from the start state. (uses a lot of memory to do that) #inefficient.
- `BFS` is **complete** it will always find the solution, if there is one.
- `BFS`'s solution is optimal (one of the shortest possible solutions).
- All the nodes remain in memory, so both time and space complexity are Exponential. `O(b`<sup>`d`</sup>`)`

## De-queue Based implementation
Script can be found [here](Scripts/2_2_Queue_Based_BFS.py).
```py
def bfs_queue(start, goal, next_states):
    Frontier = deque([start])
    Parent = {start: start}
    while len(Frontier) > 0:
        state = Frontier.popleft()
        if state == goal:
            return path_to(state, Parent)
        new_states = next_states(state)
        for ns in new_states:
            if ns not in Parent:
                Parent[ns] = state
                Frontier.append(ns)
```
- This implementation uses the `deque` package and implements a *double-ended queue*, which is implemented as a *doubly linked list*.
- This implimentation is slighly faster than the previous one. However, Breadth-First Search still has a memory limitation.
