# Uniform Cost Search or Dijkstra's algorithm

## Show me the code ðŸ¤“

## How does it work?

## Important Information 
- A `breadth first search` that uses a priority queue sorted using the depth of the nodes from the root.
- Guaranteed to find the shortest solution path.
- Can explore large trees of actions with low costs before exploring paths involving a high-cost and perhaps useful action.
- Complete and cost-optimal
  - because the first solution it finds will have a cost that is at least as low as the cost of any other node in the frontier.
