# Iterative Deepening
The main idea is to run depth first with a depth limit `d` which enforces the idea that a solution exists with at most a length of `d`. If no solution is found then we try a new depth `d+1`, and iterate until a solution is found.
## Show me the code ðŸ¤“
```py
def search(start, goal, next_states):
    limit = 1
    while True:
        Path = dls(start, goal, next_states, [start], {start}, limit)
        if Path != None:
            return Path
        limit += 1


def dls(state, goal, next_states, Path, PathSet, limit):
    if state == goal:
        return Path
    if len(Path) == limit:
        return None
    for ns in next_states(state):
        if ns not in PathSet:
            Path.append(ns)
            PathSet.add(ns)
            Result = dls(ns, goal, next_states, Path, PathSet, limit)
            if Result != None:
                return Result
            else:
                Path.pop()
                PathSet.remove(ns)
    return None
```
## How does it work?
1. The function `search` initializes the variable `limit` to `1` and tries to find a solution to the problem with a length that is less than or equal to `limit`.
2. If a solution is found, return it. Otherwise, the variable `limit` is incremented and we start a new `depth first search`.
3. The function `dls`(depth limited search) is a recursive `depth first search` computing only the paths with length that is at most `limit`. 
## Important Information 
- Uses depth first search but with a maximum depth before going to the next level.
- Requires little memory and finds the shortest path.
