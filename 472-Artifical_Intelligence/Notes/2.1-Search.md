# Searching
Briefly put, rather than developing a program to solve a specific problem, we implement an algorithm that can solve a whole class of problems. Then, in to solve a problem within this class, we just specify the problem, which is much easier than solving it from scratch.

## Definition of a Search Problem
**A search problem** is a Tuple of the form:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\bg_black&space;P&space;=&space;\left&space;\langle&space;Q,&space;next\_states,\:&space;start,\:&space;goal&space;\right&space;\rangle" title="P = \left \langle Q, next\_states,\: start,\: goal \right \rangle" />

Where:
1. `Q` is the set of state. Which is the `state space` briefly introduced earlier.
2. `next_states` is a function that takes a state as an input and returns the set of those states that are reachable. For example `Q` &#10141; `2`<sup>`Q`</sup>
   - This implies a **transition relation** `R`, which is a relation on `Q`. so we can have `R ⊆ Q x Q`. This is formallyy defined as :

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\bg_black&space;\small&space;R:=&space;\{\left&space;\langle&space;s_1,\:s_2&space;\right&space;\rangle&space;\epsilon\:\:&space;Q&space;\times&space;Q&space;|&space;S_2&space;\:&space;\epsilon\:\:&space;next\_states(s_1)&space;\}" title="\small R:= \{\left \langle s_1,\:s_2 \right \rangle \epsilon\:\: Q \times Q | S_2 \: \epsilon\:\: next\_states(s_1) \}" />

If either of these cases are true then `s1` and `s2` are called **neighboring states**.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\bg_black&space;\small&space;\begin{cases}&space;&&space;\text{&space;if&space;}&space;\left&space;\langle&space;s_1,\:s_2&space;\right&space;\rangle&space;\epsilon\:\:&space;R\\&space;&&space;\text{&space;if&space;}&space;\left&space;\langle&space;s_2,\:s_1&space;\right&space;\rangle&space;\epsilon\:\:&space;R&space;\end{cases}" title="\small \begin{cases} & \text{ if } \left \langle s_1,\:s_2 \right \rangle \epsilon\:\: R\\ & \text{ if } \left \langle s_2,\:s_1 \right \rangle \epsilon\:\: R \end{cases}" />

3. `start` is the **start state** hence `start ∈ Q`.
4. `goal` is the **goal state**, hence `goal ∈ Q`.
   - Sometimes we can have more than one goal, a set of goal states `Goals`.

5. How do we define paths:
   - The **paths** is a list `[s`<sub>`1`</sub>`,...,s`<sub>`n`</sub>`]` such that:
     -  `s`<sub>`i+1`</sub> `∈ next_states(s`<sub>`i`</sub>`)` for **all** `i ∈ {1, ..., n-1}`.
   - The *length* is defined as the length of the list - 1.
     - That's because the paths consists of `n-1` **edges**.
6. A **path** `[s`<sub>`1`</sub>`,...,s`<sub>`n`</sub>`]`  is a solution to the given problem **iff**:
   - `s`<sub>`1`</sub>`= start`. Meaning that the first element of the path is thee start state.
   - `s`<sub>`n`</sub>`= goal`. Meaning that the last element of the path is the goal state.
## Example - Missionaries and cannibals problem:

```
Three missionaries and three infidels have to cross
a river that runs from the north to the south. Initially, both the missionaries and the infidels are on the western shore. There is just one small boat that can carry at most two passengers.
Both the missionaries and the infidels can steer the boat. However, if at any time the missionaries are confronted with a majority of infidels on either shore of the river, then the missionaries have a problem.
```

## Theoretical Solution:
1. If `m` is the number of missionaries on a given shore, and `i` is the number of infidels on the same shore. Then `problem(m,i)` is `True` **iff** the missionaries have a problem on that shore.
    - There exists a problem if the number of missionaries is greater than `0` but less than the number of infidels.
2. If `m` is the number of missionaries on the western shore and `i` is the number of infidels on that shore. Then `no_problem(m,i)` is `True`, if there is no problem for the missioaries on either shore.
   - Given that if `m` is the number of missionaries on the western shoire, then `3-m` is the number of missionaries on the eastern shore.
   - Similarly for `i`, number of infidels on eastern shore is `3-i`.
3. We define a state `s` as a triple `s=(m,i,b)` where `m ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3},` and `b ∈ {0, 1}`.


## Programming implementation
Script is [here](../472-Artifical_Intelligence/Scripts/1-Missionaries.py)
```py
#Variables are : missionaries, infidels, boats on western shore

def problem(m, i): return 0 < m < i


def no_problem(m, i): return not problem(m, i) and not problem(3-m, 3-i)


def next_states(state):
    m, i, b = state
    # Boat is on western shore?
    if b == 1:
        # Then states reachable from the state are the states where mb and ib cross the river so m-mb missionaries and i-ib infidels remain on the western shore.
        return{(m-mb, i-ib, 0)
               # mb ∈ {0, · · · , m}
               for mb in range(m+1)
               # ib ∈ {0, · · · , i}
               for ib in range(i+1)
               # people crossing min 1 max
               if 1 <= mb + ib <= 2 and
               # should have no problem
               no_problem(m-mb, i-ib)
               }
    # Boat is on the eastern shore => Number of m and i on western shore increased.
    else:
        return{(m+mb, i+ib, 1) for mb in range(3-m+1)
               for ib in range(3-i+1)
               if 1 <= mb + ib <= 2 and
               no_problem(m+mb, i+ib)
               }

# Start and goal states.
start = (3, 3, 1)
goal = (0, 0, 0)

# Could also be like this, but this will get huge with more complex problems.
States = { (m, i, b) for m in {0, 1, 2, 3}
                     for i in {0, 1, 2, 3}
                     for b in {0, 1}
                     if no_problem(m, i)
        }
```


Ok so now that we know more about defining problems, State space and our objective to solving problems, here's the table of content for the list of all the types of search we will learn to solve different problems.
