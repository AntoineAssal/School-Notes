# Depth-Limited Search
To keep depth-first search from going down an infinite path, we  use depth-limited search, a version of depth-first search in which we supply a depth limit, and treat all nodes at depth as if they had no successors.

## How does it work?


## Important Information 
- Time complexity is `O(b`<sup>`L`</sup>`)`
- Space complexity is `O(bL)`
- If we make a poor choice for our depth limit `L`m the algorithm will fail to reach the solution, making it incomplete.
