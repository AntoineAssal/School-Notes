# Searching
Briefly put, rather than developing a program to solvea specific problem, we implement an algorithm that can solve a whole class of problems. Then, in to solve a problem within this class, we just specify the problem, which is much easier than solving it from scratch.

## Definition of a Search Problem
**A search problem** is a Tuple of the form:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\bg_black&space;P&space;=&space;\left&space;\langle&space;Q,&space;next\_states,\:&space;start,\:&space;goal&space;\right&space;\rangle" title="P = \left \langle Q, next\_states,\: start,\: goal \right \rangle" />

Where:
- `Q` is the set of state. Which is the `state space` briefly introduced earlier.
- `next_states` is a function that takes a state as an input and returns the set of those states that are reachable. For example `Q` &#10141; `2`<sup>`Q`></sup>






## Example - Missionaries and cannibals problem:








Ok so now that we know about State space and our objective on solving problems, here's the table of content to look the list of all the types of search we will learn.
